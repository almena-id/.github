# Almena ID

A decentralized identity platform built to give people and organizations full control over their digital identities. It allows users to create secure self-owned identities, receive verifiable credentials (certificates, licenses, memberships), and share them with any organization that needs to validate them — all without intermediaries or centralized databases. 🔐🌐

The platform connects three essential roles:

* Issuers – organizations that provide trusted digital credentials. 🏛️
* Users – individuals who store credentials in their personal wallet and decide when to share them. 👤💼
* Verifiers – entities that instantly confirm the authenticity of shared information. ✔️

Key principles include privacy by design, data minimization, and user sovereignty — ensuring that each person keeps full control of their information at all times. The goal is to simplify onboarding, reduce fraud, eliminate paperwork, and improve trust across sectors such as education, employment, healthcare, public services, and digital onboarding. 🚀

The project combines decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials, and distributed storage to create a future-ready identity ecosystem where trust flows smoothly and securely.
